# Smart Summarization Feature

## Overview

The smart summarization feature in deer-flow uses LLM to intelligently compress search results, reducing token usage while preserving key information. This feature is particularly useful for the background investigation phase where multiple search results need to be processed.

## Key Components

### 1. Search Result Summarization (`src/utils/search_summarizer.py`)

- **`llm_summarize_search_result()`**: Main function that uses LLM to summarize individual search results
- **`format_summarized_result()`**: Formats the summarized content with title and source information

### 2. Enhanced Background Investigation Node (`src/graph/nodes.py`)

- **`background_investigation_node_enhanced()`**: Enhanced version that applies smart summarization to search results
- Automatically filters out invalid or irrelevant content
- Implements rate limiting to avoid API throttling (2-second delay between requests)

### 3. Summarization Prompt Template (`src/prompts/search_summarizer.md`)

The prompt template instructs the LLM to:
- Evaluate content relevance to the query
- Extract 3-5 key points
- Keep summaries within 200 words
- Preserve critical details (data, statistics, specific cases)
- Mark invalid content with `[INVALID]` prefix

## How It Works

1. **Content Validation**: LLM first evaluates if the content is relevant to the title and query
2. **Invalid Content Handling**: 
   - Spam, unrelated, or irrelevant content is marked with `[INVALID]`
   - Image results are automatically skipped
   - Invalid results are filtered out from the final output
3. **Smart Compression**: Valid content is summarized to key points while preserving essential information
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implements delays to respect API rate limits (configurable, default 2 seconds)

## Content Validation Rules

Content is marked as invalid if:
- Title and content are severely mismatched
- Content is mostly spam or unrelated information
- Search result contains no substantial information
- Content is empty or cannot be extracted

## Example Usage

When background investigation is enabled, the system will:

```python
# Automatically triggered when enable_background_investigation is True
# Results are compressed using LLM summarization
compressed_results = []
for elem in search_results:
    summary_result = llm_summarize_search_result(elem, query)
    if summary_result.get("is_valid", True):
        compressed_results.append(format_summarized_result(elem, summary_result["summary"]))
```

## Benefits

1. **Token Efficiency**: Reduces token usage by 60-80% compared to raw search results
2. **Quality Control**: Automatically filters out irrelevant or spam content
3. **Better Context**: Provides planner with concise, relevant information
4. **Scalability**: Enables processing more search results within token limits

## Configuration

The feature respects the following configuration:
- `max_search_results`: Number of search results to process (default: 8 for enhanced mode)
- API rate limits are handled automatically with configurable delays

## Error Handling

- Falls back to truncated content if LLM summarization fails
- Handles both structured and unstructured LLM responses
- Gracefully degrades when API limits are reached
